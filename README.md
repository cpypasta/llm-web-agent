# llm-web-agent

This repo has a number of streamlit apps that demonstrate various capabilities of LLM to have agency.

Streamlit Apps:
1. [Agent Chat](https://langchain-agent.streamlit.app/): have a chat with OpenAI with access to tools.
2. [Open Chat](https://open-chat.streamlit.app/): chat with many open source LLMs locally and from cloud providers.
